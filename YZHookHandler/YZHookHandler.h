YZHookHandler uses Objective-C message forwarding to hook into messages. This will create some overhead. Don't add hook to methods that are called a lot. YZHookHandler is meant for view/controller code that is not called a 1000 times per second.

Adding hook returns a handler which can be used to deregister again. All calls are thread safe.
